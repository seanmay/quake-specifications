Current ops: create a repository for tools and information I have on my hard drive.

Much of the tools or scripts to use them I created myself.  Along with much documentation.
Some of this used to be found on the web, but now it is getting scarce.

Where credit is specified in a file, I will consider that credit given.
If not, and I know who is responsible, I will include that information.

If I put something up, and you want credit (and have proof...) let me know.

The point is to keep quake development alive.


Included in this repository:

Quake spec 3.4.3
Quake C manual v1.01 (html linked version)
Quake C code base (html linked version)
Quake FAQ (unofficial) v2.0 - sept 1996
Master entities.def (GTK radiant) v1.8.1
FTE qcc precompiler, keywords, warning v1.0

I plan to add some documents to this when I have some time to do the proper editing.
